##New LÖVE
My version of a new LÖVE project. Whenever I set up a [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) project I make something similar to this:

- [cargo](https://github.com/bjornbytes/cargo) provides easy asset management
- bewClass script makes creating lua objects quicker
- basic color table so I don't have to remember colors
- exposed conf.lua file
- [JSON.lua](http://regex.info/blog/lua/json) allows for serialization of simple tables for saving and loading game state

LÖVE doesn't really force any design pattern on you like other game engines (which is one of the reasons it is so good!). This is what works for me. Enjoy!
